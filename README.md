## Description

This is a PowerShell script for automation of routine tasks/setting on Windows 10. <br /> 
This is by no means a complete set of settings. (There is ALOT that can be changed/done)

This script originally created by https://github.com/Disassembler0/Win10-Initial-Setup-Script/

This script is a Modded version of the 2.0 script by Disaseembler0. <br />
The script has added items with an easier way to change preferences.

## Usage
edit the file<br />
change setting you want (# will give what settings can be for that function) <br />
**Note: If you're not sure what something does dont change it or do a web search** <br />
save the file <br />
choose *Run with PowerShell* <br />
confirm execution policy change. <br>
Make sure your account is a member of Administrators group as the script attempts to run with elevated privileges. <br />

PS. I removed the import of a parameter file that was in the original Script, but I May re-add it later.
