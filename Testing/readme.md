# Currently Testing
The update.bat in this folder..<br />
Will allow you to check for update to script(s) and will download it if there is an update

# About Testing Version
If I am not working on a change or addition to the script, this will be the same exact copy as the non test.<br />
Only Differances between script are:
1. Version Check will download the 'Test' version instead of 'Stable' (if there is an update)
2. Display of a Warning message at 'TOS screen'
3. Computer wont restart (even if Restart is set)
4. Error messages are shown (From all sources)

**Note: Use the copy here if you dont mind possible bugs or problems.**<br />
